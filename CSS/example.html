                <h2>React</h2>
                <img src="../images/react.png" alt="react logo">
                <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6]. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. However, fetching data is only the beginning of what happens on a web page, which is why complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API[7][8]; Redux[9], React Router[10] and axios[11] are respective examples of such libraries.</p>
